MAID - Memory Address Information Dumper
--

MAID is an ISA-independent Pin tool that will output file:lineno (if known)
and a callstack each time a user-specified effective memory address is touched.


BUILDING MAID
--

Unpack maid in the top level of the Pin distribution (i.e. pin-2.0/maid)

Type make
Type make test


COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
--

--addrfile=<address file>
    Tell MAID to look in a file for a list of addresses to monitor

--outfile=<output file>
    Tell MAID to send all reporting information to a file.  If not specified,
    reports will be sent to stdout.


REGISTERING ADDRESSES
--

Additionally, addresses may be registered (and unregistered) at runtime with 
the functions:

    MAID_register_address(void *)
    MAID_unregister_address(void *)

Please note that to use these functions, you must define them yourself as
    void MAID_register_address(void *addr) {}
    void MAID_unregister_address(void *addr) {}

Since g++ may prepend and append random stuff to the function names, MAID
searches for functions containing the above substrings.  Therefore, it is not
advisable to have other functions with names similar to those above.


EXAMPLES
--

Have a look at addrfile.txt and tests/foo.c

To run maid:

pin -t ./maid [options] -- tests/foo


BUGS
--

gcc and g++ aren't so great at providing file:lineno information.  Using icc
to compile your application will probably result in higher quality output.
