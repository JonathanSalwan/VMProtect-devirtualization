# This file defines (indirectly via include files) all the variables necessary for building tools and running tests.
# A detailed list of the variables defined in each file is available below.
#
# In addition, this files defines the common make targets.
# 
# All aforementioned variables can be overridden from the command line, however it is not recommended to do so.
# In order to safely obtain more control over the build process, the user may define the following variables in
# the command line:
#
# PIN_ROOT      - Specify the location for the Pin kit when building a tool outside of the kit.
# CC            - Override the default c compiler for tools.
# CXX           - Override the default c++ compiler for tools
# APP_CC        - Override the default c compiler for applications and any additional object or shared object files.
#                 If not defined, APP_CC will be the same as CC.
# APP_CXX       - Override the default c++ compiler for applications and any additional object or shared object files.
#                 If not defined, APP_CXX will be the same as CXX.
# TARGET        - Override the default target architecture e.g. for cross-compilation.
# ICC           - When ICC=1 is specified, the test binaries will be built will be done with the Intel compiler.
# GCCVER        - On Linux, icc requires some utilities from the gcc toolchain. This specifies which gcc version to use.
#                 If a version is not specified, the default system libraries and compiler will be used.
#                 Relevant only on Linux when ICC=1.
# BINUTILS_PATH - Define a path to a different set of binutils for the linker. Relevant on Unix only.
# DEBUG         - When DEBUG=1 is specified, debug information will be generated and no optimizations will be performed.
# PIN_TESTING   - When PIN_TESTING=1 is specified, Pin will be invoked with additional flags which will add some internal
#                 testing. Note that this may incur a performance penalty.
# PINFLAGS      - Use this to add Pin flags when running the tests. Usage: make PINFLAGS=<extra flags> ...
# INSTALLER     - Specify a script for adding functionality to the "install" target. The script will run after the entire
#                 build completes successfully.
# INSTALL_FLAGS - Specify command line arguments to be passed to the installer script (see above).
# CMD_PREFIX    - A prefix which will be added to all executed shell commands.
