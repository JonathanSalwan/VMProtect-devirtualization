b GLOBAL_FUNCTION

# There are 8 worker threads and each worker will stop twice
# (breakpoint at GlobalFunction() and tool breakpoint).  We
# need one more "continue" to cause the process to exit.  It's
# likely that multiple breakpoints will happen simultaneously,
# so we probably won't need to continue this many times, but
# it's an upper bound.

# 17 = 8*2 + 1
