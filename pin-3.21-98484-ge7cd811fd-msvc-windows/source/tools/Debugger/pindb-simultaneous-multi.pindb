# There are 8 worker threads and each worker will stop 4 times
# (thread-start, breakpoint at GlobalFunction(), tool breakpoint,
# and thread-exit).  We need one more "continue" to cause the
# process to exit.  It's likely that multiple breakpoints will
# happen simultaneously, so we probably won't need to continue
# this many times, but it's an upper bound.
