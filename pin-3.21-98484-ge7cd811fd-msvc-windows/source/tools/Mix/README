There are 4 pintools here: 

1) mix: single threaded runs only!! does not appropriately handle threads in user apps.

2) mix-mt: handles variable number of threads. Designed for windows which creates/destroys 
   lots of threads. This is probably the one you want to use.

3) mix-mt2 : simpler verison without the controller. does not handle markers.

4) mix-mt-fixed: fixed maximum number of threads.

---------------------------------------------------------------

This program is called "mix" (or mix-mt, etc.). It  does static and dynamic:
	instruction mix counting, or
	ISA extension counting, or
        ISA category counting.

(Note: static profiles are only available on Linux and macOS*. Not on Windows).

---------------------------------------------------------------

The mix-mt program has a special knob called -mapaddr which emits
information about the counts associated with file/line numbers of the
soures to the output file.  The output file is parsed by the
summarize.py script in this directory and will create .pcov files
which decorate the counts on the sources.

The summarize.py script will sort and combine lines that have the same
line number (but different pc values). It will decorate any sources
that are writable, making a new source file suffixed with .pcov.

The counts are ranked from most frequent to least frequent.  Each
decorated source line has the ranking and the instruction count. The
ranking is prefixed by "AA" to facilitate grepping for them in the
.pcov files.

Note: you are still required to supply -opcode, -category or
      -extension as a pin tool argument/knob.

Note: It is possible to get separate counts for different threads.
      The summarize.py script does not support this this yet.

---------------------------------------------------------------


Here is an example user program with marker functions called marker-example.cpp. 

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
extern "C" 
{
 void marker_start_counting() {}
 void marker_stop_counting() {}
 void marker_emit_stats() {}
 void marker_zero_stats() {}
} // end of extern "C"

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    for (int i=0;i<3;i++)
    {
        marker_zero_stats();
        marker_start_counting();
        cout << "Hello" << endl;
        marker_stop_counting();
        marker_emit_stats();
    }
    marker_zero_stats(); // this is important or the final stats will be double-tallied
    return 0;
}


To run mix on the compiled program marker-example, use the following command:

../Bin/pin -t ./mix -category -start_address marker_start_counting:repeat -stop_address marker_stop_counting:repeat -zero_stats_address marker_zero_stats:repeat -emit_stats_address marker_emit_stats:repeat -- ./marker-example

In the above, we specify 5 options to the pin tool:

   -category   
             Indicates we should count instruction categories. Other options
	     include -opcode or -extension .

  -start_address marker_start_counting:repeat

             This option is the name of the function that causes us to
             start counting. The :repeat indicates that all occurrences of
             this function should initiate counting.  A nonzero value
             after the colon would indicate that the N'th instance of
             the execution of this function should initiate counting.
             If there is no colon and number, the default is 1, which
             indicates just the first instance of this symbol would
             initiate counting.
        
  -stop_address marker_stop_counting:repeat 
	      This is the start marker function. The :repeat acts like in -start_address.

  -zero_stats_address marker_zero_stats:repeat 
	      This is the marker to zero the stats. The :repeat acts like in -start_address.

  -emit_stats_address marker_emit_stats:repeat 
	      This is the marker to emit the stats. The :repeat acts like in -start_address.
	      All stats are dumped to the same output file.


The output file defaults to mix.out. That file name can be changed with the -o pintool option.

Markers have the following general format:
	
	marker[:count][:repeat]

Order does not matter for the optional components, shown in square brackets above.

The ":count" indicates the number of times that the marker must be reach before the event
specified by the knob occurs.  The default count is 1 if no count is given.  Events are only
triggered once unless the ":repeat" option is provided as well.


The  "marker" can be:
    - A hex number         (e.g. 0x40002344)
    - A symbol             (e.g. main)
    - A symbol + offset    (e.g. main+0x123)
    - A image name + an offset in to the text section (e.g. /usr/lib/libc.a+0x4325)


Some examples of options that can be passed to the above (start/stop/zero/emit) switches:

     marker          (will cause an event to occur once, the first time marker is executed)
     marker:3        (will cause an event to occur once, the third time marker is executed)
     marker:3:repeat (will cause an event to occur every third time marker is executed)
     marker:repeat   (will cause an event to occur every time marker is executed)


There are other switches that can allow more sophisticated sampling behavior.

To get the pintool help/usage message use this:	

  ../Bin/pin -t ./mix -help -- ./marker-example



----------

Multithreading support

1) the mix tool requires an upper bound on the number of threads via
the tool switch: "-max_threads N" where N is the number of threads <=
MAX_THREADS, currently defined to be 64.  Mix requires this number so
that it opens one output file per thread at the start of the run. See
the makefile target test-mt.test for an example.

2) If you have more than one thread, the thread id is appended to the
output file name, after a "."
